## Advanced Microbit examples
### Demonstrating the use of Microbit with additional hardware.
---
_For now this is only quick & dirty. I meant to show students that Microbit is an adult embedded system._

My students are all Dutch, so comments on Youtube are also Dutch. Sorry about that...

All examples are based on Arduino library examples, so nothing fancy.

The links point to [my Youtube channel](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCTQTy1JXbaVe0rx_E8yBXkQ). You can find the extra information over there. Have fun!
